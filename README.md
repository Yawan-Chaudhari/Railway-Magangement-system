        Develop a function to display the list of available trains to users.

    Seat Availability:
        Implement a system to track seat availability for each train.
        Display the number of seats remaining for a particular train and class.

    Booking a Ticket:
        Design a user interface or command-line prompts for users to enter their details and select a train.
        Update seat availability and store booking details in the passenger database.

    Cancel a Ticket:
        Develop a feature for users to cancel their booked tickets.
